too much supervision. They become more reliable on the job and thus, it increases the quality of their teaching and the overall service of the volunteer organization. These factors increase the confidence of parents towards the volunteers and the organization as whole and can help in acquiring more students and volunteers in the future. 

2)  Selection process is manaegable in terms of process and cost - The organization is able to skip ome of the more formal processes when it 
comes to recruitment and selection. For example, extensive assessments and multiple interviews are not necessarily needed. It is also not
costly to do because it is easier to coordinate the interviewers during the interview phase. the simplified process of recruitment and selection process of organizations like this could take be advantageous when it comes to filtering oyt candidates for the job.  

3)  Work flow and job design is not complex - Formulating the specifications and the duties that comes with the job for the volunteers is 
easier compared to bigger corporate companies. Volunteering organizations are more straight forward and often, does not require complex skills
and knowledge that a traditional company may require. For example, while aspiring volunteers for the coding classes must have a programming background as mentioned in the interview, the simplicity of the job is unparalleled compared to applying as a software engineer in a more formal setup or a coding instructor in academe. 

4)  Mediation to resolve conflicts is easier - Conflicts are easily resolved because of the organization's small setup. Opting to solve conflicts internally is likely. This benefits the organization and the parties in conflict because find a solution is easier when parties
can have a more direct dialogue. When resolving issues and conflicts, this could be mediated by Camilia herself as she have an active
role in the organization. This skips all the formal processes that a bigger/unionized organizations have to go through. In turn, these practices would save time and effort among the people who are involved. 

5) Performance Management is direct and fast - Feedbacks could be given almost immediately. This increases the organization's performance management because feedbacks can be easily managed and can be delivered directly and actively.
