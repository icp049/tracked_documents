Strength Explanations
 1) Great mentorship for training and development - a small organization has a more hands on mentorship for their employees. These promotes a more active approach when it comes to training and development of the volunteers. This makes them ready in teaching the kids faster without
too much supervision. They become more reliable on the job and thus, it increases the quality of their teaching and the overall service of the volunteer organization. These factors increase the confidence of parents towards the volunteers and the organization as whole and can help in acquiring more students and volunteers in the future. 

2)  Selection process is manaegable in terms of process and cost - The organization is able to skip ome of the more formal processes when it 
comes to recruitment and selection. For example, extensive assessments and multiple interviews are not necessarily needed. It is also not
costly to do because it is easier to coordinate the interviewers during the interview phase. the simplified process of recruitment and selection process of organizations like this could take be advantageous when it comes to filtering oyt candidates for the job.  

3)  Work flow and job design is not complex - Formulating the specifications and the duties that comes with the job for the volunteers is 
easier compared to bigger corporate companies. Volunteering organizations are more straight forward and often, does not require complex skills
and knowledge that a traditional company may require. For example, while aspiring volunteers for the coding classes must have a programming background as mentioned in the interview, the simplicity of the job is unparalleled compared to applying as a software engineer in a more formal setup or a coding instructor in academe. 

4)  Mediation to resolve conflicts is easier - Conflicts are easily resolved because of the organization's small setup. Opting to solve conflicts internally is likely. This benefits the organization and the parties in conflict because find a solution is easier when parties
can have a more direct dialogue. When resolving issues and conflicts, this could be mediated by Camilia herself as she have an active
role in the organization. This skips all the formal processes that a bigger/unionized organizations have to go through. In turn, these practices would save time and effort among the people who are involved. 

5) Performance Management is direct and fast - Feedbacks could be given almost immediately. This increases the organization's performance management because feedbacks can be easily managed and can be delivered directly and actively. For example, it was mentioned in the interview that feedbacks are given on 1 on 1 meeting setup. Additionally, coachings are also provided if needed. Direct supervision is also seen as Camilia supervises the volunteers until they can be left alone. This makes improvement and correction faster and makes the organization better overall. 


Weaknesses Explanations
1) Funding is limited - Lack of funding would put limitations on the organization's ability to attract the manpower
they need and it will also limit it's ability to compensate their workers thus, affecting their rewards syetsm when it comes to providing
direct or monetary compensations. However, this has always been the nature of volunteer organizations, and volunteers are usually
aware of these circumstances

2) Workforce planning could be complex because the labour supply and demand is not constant. Recruitment would be based of how many
volunteers are needed to cater the number of people actively reached by the organization. This would not benefit the organization when 
there is too much people to cater and they lack the manpower or vice versa, wherein there is too much volunteers with nothing to do.

3) Voluntary Turnovers - The volunteers usually have different priorities of their volunteering. This may limit their ability to be
able to contibute in the organization. These circumstances may raise the risk of sudden voluntary absence during volunteering activities or
classes. These may also raise the risk of volunteers just leaving for no reason since it is a "voluntary" work. 

4) Authority is centralized and may be overwhelmed - Although it is still a small organization, Camilia handles a lot of things by
herself. She handles the strategic direction, operations, training and development, supervising and recruitment. AS the leading authority in the organization. Multiple things could also be a burden for her and might induce fatigue. Assuming that she has opther priorities outside of the organization, this may affect her performance managing the organization. A good separation of duty would be recommended, however, this may also have limitations if volunteers come and go. 

Opportunities Explanations

1) Volunteer Network Growth - Volunteer organizations are very welcoming. Due to this nature, it would be very easy to widen 
social connections and work networks within the organization specially for the volunteers inside. Camilia herself, could also benefit from the new people that she meets after recruitment as more people could mean more progress and development. 

2) Remote Environment - In an HR perspective, a remote environment is beneficial because of its convenience. The things mentioned above such as training and development, feedbacks, and even conflicts could be done in just a simple click wherever you are in the world.
These makes the delivery of these things fast and easy. While the organization shifted to this approach during the COvid-19 Pandemic, I would
suggest that they keep these practices because it is clearly working for an organization which aims to teach classes remotely. They should
embrace it and maximize it moving forward.

3)  Diverse workforce when it comes to race, knowledge, skills etc. - It was mentioned in the interview that the organization aims to
diversify there workforce. It also mentioned that the volunteers come from different backgrounds. FOr example,  Some are working professionals and some are students. The diversification of the organization is advantagous in a way that skills, cultures, personalities
are also diversified. These greatly affects the dynamics of the organization as a whole. Internally, people are able to adapt to new people.
Externally, it would be a nice way to show that the volunteer represent different people from different ethnicities and backgrounds. Specially for a volunteer organization that aims to make a change, this is very valuable.
