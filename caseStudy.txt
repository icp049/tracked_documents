Confirmation Bias can be seen in how Robert pushes the narrative of Jacqueline being advantageous over Sonya because she is married. As irrelevant as it 
is, Robert tried to relate her marriage with stability. He also tends to repeatedly lean on the fact that he chose Jacqueline because of her prior sales 
experience. Furthermore, he said that Sonya's enthusiasm and energy as trait that may potentially turn their customers off. While these are all based off 
how Robert weighed the pros and cons of getting one candidate over the other one. It seems that these narratives were only used to mask the fact that 
he's leaning towards hiring Jacqueline because of diversity goals for the company as he aims to diversify his workforce. This has always been his main goal and he atempts to support his case by backing it up with irrelevant reasoning.


The halo effect can be seen in how Paul is more inclined on hiring Sonya because of her enthusiastic attitude. While Sonya is also a qualified candidate 
for the position, her enthusiasm and how Paul paul uses it as his case to hire her kind of amplifies her other qualifications whic


The horns effect can be seen in how Paul describes Jacqueline as "standoffish" and he tends to lean on this reasoning to defend his case on hiring 
Sonya instead of comparing their actual qualifications. While Paul perceived Jacqualine as a less unethusiastic than Sonya, It was mentioned that Paul's body language towards Jacqualine was closed during the interview as noticed by Robert. In contrast to that, he was way more positive and engaged with Sonya. As a result, these may have influenced the overall interaction during the interview.

Advantages of Panel Interviews:
1) Different perceptions and opinions towards the candidates reduces the hiring biases compared to one interviewer.  
2) Interviewers are able to diversify their questions. For example, one can concentrate on behavioural and situational questions while the other focuses on technical questions. 
3) interviewers can make a case towards or against a hiring the candidate which gives a balanced arguement to support a final decision.
4) The interviewee can have multiple feedbacks based of different opinions from multiple interviewers. 
5) Decisions are made faster because the assessment of a candidate is a collaborated efforet between the interviewers

Disadvantages of Panel Interviews:
1) If the interviewers have the same biases, this could be dentrimental to the candidate. 
2) It can also slow a decision if the interviewers takes a lot of time defending their cases and hinders their ability to produce a decision on time. 
3) A panel interview may put more pressure on the interviewee as opposed to a 1 on 1 interview
4) It is more costly to do because multiple people are involved. This requires more coordination when it comes to schedule matching
5) It is harder to get comfortable with the interviewee as multiple interviewers means that each of this interviewers only have a limited time with the interviewee.
