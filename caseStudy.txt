Confirmation Bias can be seen in how Robert pushes the narrative of Jacqueline being advantageous over Sonya because she is married. As irrelevant as it 
is, Robert tried to relate her marriage with stability. He also tends to repeatedly lean on the fact that he chose Jacqueline because of her prior sales 
experience. Furthermore, he said that Sonya's enthusiasm and energy as trait that may potentially turn their customers off. While these are all based off 
how Robert weighed the pros and cons of getting one candidate over the other one. It seems that these narratives were only used to mask the fact that 
he's leaning towards hiring Jacqueline because of diversity goals for the company as he aims to diversify his workforce. 


The halo effect can be seen in how Paul is more inclined on hiring Sonya because of her enthusiastic attitude. While Sonya is also a qualified candidate 
for the position, her enthusiasm and how Paul paul uses it as his case to hire her kind of amplifies her other qualifications whic


The horns effect can be seen in how Paul describes Jacqualine as "standoffish".
